                                     🏡 Real Estate Analytics Platform

This project is a complete analytics pipeline that takes real estate data from multiple sources, processes it, and turns it into meaningful insights, forecasts, and visualizations. It’s built to show how data engineering, analytics, and data science can come together in one place.


📊 What the Project Does

-> Pulls 20+ years of housing data from sources like Zillow, Redfin, the U.S. Census, and FRED

-> Stores and organizes everything in a PostgreSQL database

->Cleans and processes raw datasets using Python ETL scripts

-> Runs SQL + Python analytics to explore things like:

	-> Rent vs. own distribution

	-> Property type comparisons
	
	-> Ownership trends
	
	-> Yearly price growth
	
-> Builds time series forecasts (24 months ahead) using ARIMA/SARIMA models

-> Creates professional visualizations with R + ggplot2 (bar charts, line charts, heatmaps, forecasts)

-> Outputs ready-to-share CSV files, charts, and forecast reports


🛠️ Tech Used

	Python → pandas, SQLAlchemy, statsmodels, scikit-learn

	SQL / PostgreSQL → optimized schema + indexed queries
	
    R (ggplot2) → for clear and polished data visualizations
	
	APIs → Zillow, Redfin, Census, FRED

🎯 Why I Built This

I wanted a project that feels close to a real-world data platform—something that pulls in messy data, organizes it in a database, processes it, and produces results that are useful and easy to understand. It’s not just about writing scripts; it’s about building a pipeline that combines data engineering, analytics, and visualization into one workflow.

🤝 Contributing

I’m open to suggestions and improvements! If you’d like to contribute, feel free to fork the repo and submit a pull request.

🙏 Acknowledgments

This project has been one of the most exciting parts of my learning journey. I want to sincerely thank Dr. Hemanth Purohit, who not only gave me the initial idea for building this project but also guided me throughout the process. His teaching and mentorship made me appreciate the power of R for data visualization and analytics, and his encouragement left a lasting impact on how I approach data-driven projects.

🎉 Closing Note

The Real Estate Analytics Platform was built as both a practical project and a learning experience. It brings together data engineering, analytics, forecasting, and visualization in a way that reflects real-world workflows. More importantly, it gave me the chance to explore new tools, challenge myself, and grow as a data professional.

Thank you for taking the time to explore this project! 🚀
